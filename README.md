As a first part of project we have to basically collect all data from given URL into a csv file to do so 
first we have to reach the HTML tree that is formed and we have to extract information as per our use...
and finally converting the data we get into csv type using pandas

for the second part we have to basically go through the CSV file that we made through its name coloum so that we can get name of a particular person and using simple python tools to check whether it is right or wrong and storing and printing the wrong name according to question
for that json task i basically convert that into CSV file and get a run through it over the right names that it contains its name or not...

And finally i got that only one person holds that task so simply appendings its specifications and projects in it.
pip install bs4
pip install requests
pip install pandas
these are basic command given to start a project
I convert JSON TO CSV using pandas library i think this to be the best way to deal with this problem...
if anything else was expected then guide me with that
